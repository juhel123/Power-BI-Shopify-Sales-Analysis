This project involves using Power BI to connect, analyze, and display sales data from a Shopify store. It transforms raw transaction data—such as orders, revenue, customer demographics, and product performance—into interactive dashboards and visual reports. This helps businesses track sales trends, monitor key metrics, identify best-selling products, and make data-driven decisions to improve e-commerce performance.
